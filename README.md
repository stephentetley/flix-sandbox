# flix-sandbox

Incubator project for candidate library modules for Flix.

Note November 2021 - the regex modules have been moved into a
separate repo so they can be used without the dependencies `flix-sandbox`
needs. The new repo is:

https://github.com/stephentetley/flix-regex

March 2022 - the project layout has changed to work with Flix's 
package manager so it should be easier to build and use.
